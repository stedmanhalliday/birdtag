# Birdtag

Birdtag lets you add persistent custom labels next to display names on X (Twitter), helping you keep track of people in a way that makes sense to you.

Easily annotate usernames with nicknames, fun badges, notes about their posts, reminders about where you met them, or anything else you find useful. Labels appear right above display names across the site, making it effortless to recall important details at a glance.

**Key features**

ðŸ”µ Right-click any display name to add, edit, or remove a label<br>
ðŸ”µ Labels persist across sessions, stored locally on your browser<br>
ðŸ”µ Seamless integrationâ€”labels appear right on the timeline<br>
ðŸ”µ Lightweight and privacy-focusedâ€”no external data collection

Birdtag helps you stay organized on X, remember key details, and personalize your browsing experience.
